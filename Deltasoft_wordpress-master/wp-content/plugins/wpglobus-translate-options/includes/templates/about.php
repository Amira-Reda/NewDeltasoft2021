In the WPGlobus core plugin, we are keeping the amount of filters as low as possible, to minimize the potential performance hit. Therefore, only two WordPress options, <strong>blogdescription</strong> and <strong>blogname</strong> are supported by default.

Sometimes, it is necessary to allow multiple languages in other options. For instance, the slider used in the Ample theme stores the textual overlays in the options table. With the WPGlobus Translate Options plugin, all you need is to add 'ample' into the Options to translate, and all the slider texts will be multilingual!
